Payday lenders operate stores in 32 states, of which only Oklahoma and the four that passed comprehensive reforms have fully shifted from high-risk, single-payment loans to those using an installment structure. Eighteen states and D.C. either have laws that explicitly prohibit payday lending or have low price caps that effectively do so.

Single-payment loans continue to be issued in 27 states, and lenders have tended to maintain them as the dominant product offering in states where it is legal to do so. For instance, they are the most common type of payday loan offered in 22 of those states and the only one offered in 13 of them. (See Figure 1.) In nine of those 22 states, lenders also offer payday installment loans or high-rate lines of credit, but they typically issue fewer of those than of single-payment loans. For example, from July 2020 to June 2021, Florida lenders originated approximately 3 million single-payment payday loans, but just 600,000 payday installment loans.12

In addition, seven states have laws that effectively limit maximum loan amounts to less than $500. Although these states also have lower borrowing costs, that is often a result only of the small loan sizes rather than actual lower prices compared with states that permit loans of $500 or higher. Most of these seven states have annual percentage rates (APRs) over 200%, with single-payment loans as the most common payday product.
