Further, since Virginia’s payday loan laws went into effect in January 2021, new firms, such as financial technology and installment lenders, have expanded into the state’s small-credit marketplace, offering lower-cost loans and providing competition for incumbent lenders that updated their products to comply with the reforms.8 Although Virginia law had previously favored high-risk products by allowing much higher rates for single-payment loans and lines of credit than for small installment loans, the state now requires a safer, more transparent, and lower- cost installment structure.9 And lenders in the state are able to operate profitably in various ways, via storefront or online, and by offering only loans or a mix of loans, check cashing, and other financial services.

The success of Ohio and Virginia’s reforms is thanks in part to the model created by Colorado in 2010, which protected consumers and provided a profitable market for lenders.10 Although lenders warned at the time that Colorado’s reform would drive them out of business, 11 years later, four of the nation’s largest payday loan chains continue to offer small installment loans in the state.
